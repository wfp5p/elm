# This file allows you to tailor Elm.
#
# The lines beginning with "#" (like this one!) are comments.
#
# Some of the option settings are commented out with "###".  This means
# that you do NOT have a value set for the option, and the system default
# will be used.  (The value shown is the default at the time this file
# was created.)  If you wish to enable one of these options, you MUST
# delete the "###" to de-comment the entry.
#
# For the yes/no settings, say ON for yes and OFF for no.
#
# For more detailed description of these settings, see the Elm Reference Guide.

showmlists

# When "showmlists" is off, a single-character mark is displayed
# to indicate who the message is to.  This four-character string
# defines the values to use for the mark.  The four characters are:
#   - Mark for mail to you and nobody else.
#   - Mark for mail to you and other recipients.
#   - Mark for mail to multiple recipients, and you are on the CC list.

# pager is used if the message is that many lines shorter than the size
# of the screen.  If zero, the external pager always is used.

# national characters.  (This becomes the "charset" parameter in the

# US-ASCII is selected.  A common choice here is "ISO-8859-1".
