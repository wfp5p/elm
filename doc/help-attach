		Elm 2.5 Message Attachments Screen

    Any file or document may be attached along with your mail message.
    Elm uses the MIME "multipart/mixed" scheme to encapsulate your
    message along with any attachments.  This menu allows you to select
    attachments for your message.

    The following commands are available in the Message Attachments Screen:

	 Key    Meaning
	 ---    -------

	  j	Move down to next attachment.
	  k	Move up to previous attachment.
	  +	Move down a screenful.
	  -	Move up a screenful.
	<NUM>	Move to the specified attachment number.
	  1	Move to first attachment.
	  *	Move to last attachment.

	  a	Add a new attachment to the message. (**)
	  d	Delete an existing attachment from the message.
	  q	Leave this menu and continue with the message.

	  f	Modify "file name" for the current attachment. (**)
	  c	Modify "content type" for the current attachment. (*)

	  ?	Display this help listing.

	   (*)	Marked commands require additional entry.  CTRL/D may be used
		to abort command and return to Attachments Screen.

	  (**)	Same as (*) ... plus you may enter a directory name
		or use patterns ("*" and "?" chars) to call up the
		File Selection Browser to select the attachment file.
		Just strike ENTER to browse the directory that contains
		the most previously added attachment.  You may abbreviate
		your mail folders directory as "=" and your home
		directory as "~".
