		Elm 2.5 Folder Selection

    You need to select a folder for the following commands:

	s)ave - Selected message(s) will be saved to the folder you select,
		and then deleted from the current folder.

	C)opy - Selected message(s) will be saved to the folder you select.

	c)hange - The folder you select will be opened for reading.

    You may abort the command and return to the Elm main menu by typing
    CTRL/D.

    If you have enabled the "Save by Name" feature, Elm will recommend
    a folder name for the s)ave and C)opy commands.  You may strike ENTER
    to accept the recommendation, or enter a different folder name.

    There are some special names you may use to select the folder.

	!		Your main "incoming" mail folder.
	>		Your "received" mail folder.
	<		Your "sent" mail folder.
	!!		The same folder used for most recent save/copy.
	=folder		Select "folder" in your saved folders directory.
	~/folder	Select "folder" in your home directory.
	~user/folder	Select "folder" in user's home directory.
	@alias		The default save folder for the "alias".

    You may specify a directory name here.  If you do, the "File Selection
    Browser" will start up to select a folder.  Here are some examples
    that would start up the browser:

	/usr/tmp	Start browser in "/usr/tmp".
	.		Start browser in current directory.
	=		Start browser in your saved folders directory.

    You also may specify a pattern for the "File Selection Browser".  If
    you do, only filenames that match the pattern will be displayed.
    The patterns use "*" to match any number of characters, and "?" to
    match any single character.  Here are some examples:

	=*joe*		Start browser in saved folders directory, and only
			    display files with "joe" somewhere in the
			    name.

	/tmp/*.gif	Start browser in the /tmp directory, and only
			    display files ending in ".gif".
