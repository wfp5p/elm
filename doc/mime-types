# mime-types - maps file extentions to MIME Content-Type values
#
# This file is used by Elm to assign a Content-Type to attach/include files.
# Unless a Content-Type is specified, Elm will search this file looking
# for a match for the extension given in field one.  At the first match
# found, the remainder of the line is taken as the Content-Type.
#
# There is an implied dot before the extension, and there can not be
# any other characters following the extension.  This first rule means
# that a file called "bigif" would NOT be assigned "image/gif".  The
# second rule means that a file called "foo.txt.Z" would NOT be assigned
# "text/plain".

# The following listing was excerpted from
# <URL: ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types >.
# It shows all of the official IANA sanctioned media types (formerly
# called MIME types) as of 20 Sept 1995.
#
# The full power of MIME is available only when the sending and receiving
# email systems agree on media type names.  It is, therefore, a really
# bad idea to invent media types on your own.  Stick with the standard
# names.
#
# If you can coordinate between the sending and receiving systems (i.e.
# people within your organization want to send spreadsheet attachments),
# it often is helpful to create media types that integrate application
# programs with the MIME system.  When you do this, however, it is an
# extremely good idea to use the "X-" experimental type prefix -- as in
# "application/x-whizzyrite-pro".
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# [RFC1521] specifies that Content Types, Content Subtypes, Character
# Sets, Access Types, and Conversion values for MIME mail will be
# assigned and listed by the IANA.
